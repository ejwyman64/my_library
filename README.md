Welcome! This project ended up being a trucated version of my original dream (I know, welcome to modern life), but I am pleased with it. 
Right now it is a basic library app where you can search for books in the Google Books API and then add them to your library, which is stored in a Firebase API. You can also manually add books to your library, delete books from your library, and change the name of your library (the library name is not stored in Firebase, so when you reload it will go back to a default name). It sounds so simple, and yet there are weeks of blood, sweat and tears behind all of this code. Minus the blood. There was only sweat and tears. Blood sounds cooler though. 

To run this app you should: 

                            Download the repository to your local comupter/device.
                            Run `npm i` in your terminal to install it.
                            Once the install is finished run `npm start`.

Enjoy using the app!
